    <h1>Welcome to my github page.</h1>
    <p>Outside of my academic life, I'm just a game designer trying to be successful. Look up ZJ Goloyogo on Itch.io if you're interested in what games I made. Also, I have been affiliated with a Stocktonian indie film production called [CJ] Studios. It would be nice if you watch [CJ] Studios on YouTube.</p>
